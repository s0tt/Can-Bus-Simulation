# Can-Bus-Simulation
Can bus simulation coded in plain C.

This is a proejct back from my studies which simulates a simple CAN network in C inside the windows console.
The user can define its own CAN architecture with specific nodes and messages.
Also a file export for the K-Matrix (automotive related communication matrix) is supported.
